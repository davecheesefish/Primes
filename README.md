# Primes
A personal project to write a prime number generator in as many programming languages as possible. A slightly more complex "Hello, world", if you will.

Some implementations may be more fully-featured than others, but they should at least be able to produce the first 1000 primes and return them from a function or output them to the console within a reasonable amount of time. Most will take input and return a user-defined quantity of prime numbers.

## Current Implementations
- [C# (console application)](./c-sharp/)
- [JavaScript (library)](./javascript/)
