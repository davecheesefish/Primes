# Primes
A personal project to create a prime number generator in as many programming languages/tools as possible. A slightly more complex "Hello, world", if you will.

Some implementations may be more fully-featured than others, but they should at least be able to produce the first 1000 primes (or as many as possible within the limitations of the language/environment) and return them from a function or output them in some manner within a reasonable amount of time.

## Current Implementations
### Mainstream Languages
Prime calculators written in languages that are used for everyday programming.
- [C++](./c-plus-plus/)
- [C#](./c-sharp/)
- [Haskell](./haskell/)
- [JavaScript](./javascript/)
- [Lua](./lua/)

### Esoteric Languages
Prime calculators written in languages that were created to serve no real useful purpose.
- [Brainfuck](./esoteric-languages/brainfuck/)

### Games
Prime calculators created by (ab)using the mechanics of an existing video game.
- [Human Resource Machine](./games/human-resource-machine/)
- [Minecraft](./games/minecraft/) (8-bit generator using vanilla redstone)
