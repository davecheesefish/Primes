# Primes
A personal project to create a prime number generator in as many programming languages/tools as possible. A slightly more complex "Hello, world", if you will.

Some implementations may be more fully-featured than others, but they should at least be able to produce the first 1000 primes (or as many as possible within the limitations of the language/environment) and return them from a function or output them in some manner within a reasonable amount of time.
