# Primes: Esoteric Languages
Since Primes is a project for me to work with as many programming languages as possible, [esoteric programming languages](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) cannot be excused. These languages range from plainly weird to horrendously rage-inducing and were never intended to be used for anything remotely useful.
