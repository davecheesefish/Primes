# Primes: JavaScript
A library for discovering prime numbers in JavaScript.

## Development Setup
First, you will need [Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Assuming you now have that, from this directory run `npm install` to install development dependencies. Check [package.json](./package.json) for details on what these dependencies include.

### Building the Project
From this directory again, run `node build/build.js` to build the project to the dist directory. Full and minified versions of the output will be produced.

### Testing the Project
Open test/index.html to run the QUnit tests in your browser of choice.
